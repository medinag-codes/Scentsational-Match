# Scentsational Matching Card Game
Scentsational Match is a frontend memory matching game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game challenges users to match pairs of cards featuring iconic and infamous perfume bottles. Each time a player clicks two cards, the game checks for a matchâ€”if the perfumes match, they stay revealed; if not, they flip back over. The goal is to match all pairs using the fewest moves possible.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

I built Perfume Pair-Up using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as a frontend-only project to practice core web development fundamentals. I created a grid of cards dynamically with JavaScript, each representing a different perfume image, and implemented logic to shuffle the cards at the start of each game to ensure random layout. I used event listeners to track user clicks, compare two selected cards, and determine whether they match. Matching cards remain visible, while non-matching pairs flip back. When all the cards are flipped, you win!

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic, while also exploring creative design through a themed visual experience.
